GitPython

Single file?
autocheckout {register collect remove(?)}

Figure out argparse


3 operations (2.5?):
	add (additional) students
	checkout tag
	revise tag (checkout again, but mess with pushed tag P1M1 -> P1M1r1)

	Oh, and removing students is probably good maybe. Probably better to toss repo, though


For adding students, super simple.

Take in the repo root, roster, and, optionally, a subdir(s) to make it under (make to to pre and post-pend slashes).
If there are submodules, scrape the userids and strip out userids that are already in the roster

Actually, maybe this is a flaw in the way it works.
Right now it makes a repo whose internal name is the student id and the repo name is the student id as well.
This means that if we were tracking multiple repos from one student, the student id needs to be modified in order to work properly.
Probably best to strip out the --name flag... Now that I've already used the register function the way it's written. OH WELL


Now the issue becomes correctly parsing the register. I had hoped to use one register, and adding students is as easy as adding lines to it.
If the student id isn't what identifies the repo anymore, this may cause it to, well, do what was requested, but in a way you probably didn't want.
I believe the repo instead gets id'd by the, well, repo name (ex: autocheckout).
That should work fine, actually.
It'll prevent duplicate repo checkouts, and that's close enough.
(what if same repo name, diff actual repos. Check out .git/modules)


GitPython has some sort of config walker, so we could parse it and check against the register's URLS.
Probably better than just passing the command, having it fail, and just assuming that's why it failed.




Checkout is so super easy. Nothing really to worry about here.
