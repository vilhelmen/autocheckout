gitpython = no. It's a not-so-great wrapper that doesn't cover all my needs

Now everything is going to be more centralized.
There will be an initialization step involved.
But that leads to the question, do we offload import to classroom tools, or just do it ourselves?

... API access to the github import tool is under development and I'm not smart enough to write the API calls manually
... Same with repo locking

So for the moment I think I may do the unthinkable and mix a library and custom api commands

https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py for general management

https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests and maybe https://github.com/sigmavirus24/uritemplate for commands for import & repo locking

Oh man.
