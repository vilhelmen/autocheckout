# CSV of student repos and their desired names
#
# git requires that names be UNIQUE
# Tracking multiple classes, or multiple iterations of a course should each have a subdir
# This will prevent future issues when you have a student twice either in the same course or different courses
# So, instead of of their id (ex: Susan2g) you'll want a subdirectory (CS215_F16/Susan2g)
#
# Comments, like these, are ignored
#
# repo_path,student_id
# repo_path is the path to a student repo (use SSH for passwordless access)
=======
# CSV of student repos and their id
# Comments have a # at the very beginning of the line and get grep'd out
# Format is: repo_url,student_id
# repo_url is the path to a student repo (use SSH for passwordless access)
>>>>>>> master
# student_id is the student's id string (which the submodule will be named)
